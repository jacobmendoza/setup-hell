## Configuration/installation adventures
Sometimes installation instructions aren't that easy or they fail to explain cases that, being a little bit more specific, are fairly common. These are my notes when trying to install some tools. Please, avoid using these notes as source of absolute knowledge or as the minimal number of steps to get something running.

My intention is to write my steps in order to clarify my mind and try to learn something about it. If you find something that is wrong or is non-optimal, I would love to hear from you.
